### Overview

The use of Behavioral Analytics in the airline industry involves analyzing data about passenger behavior, preferences, and interactions to gain insights into customer needs and improve the customer experience. This type of analysis can help airlines optimize their services, personalize their offerings, and improve operational efficiency.

Behavioral analytics in the airline industry can involve a range of applications, including predicting flight demand, identifying patterns in passenger behavior, understanding customer feedback, and developing targeted marketing campaigns.

By leveraging behavioral analytics, airlines can better understand their customers' needs and preferences, leading to more tailored and personalized experiences. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and revenue for the airline. Additionally, airlines can use behavioral analytics to improve operational efficiency, such as identifying and addressing bottlenecks in the check-in or boarding process, leading to improved on-time performance and overall customer experience.

### Methodology
The methodology for Airlines Behavioral Analytics can be broken down into several steps:

- Data Collection: Collecting the necessary data from various sources such as customer surveys, social media, website analytics, and customer databases.

- Data Preparation: Preparing the collected data for analysis by cleaning, formatting, and integrating the data. This involves identifying and addressing any missing or inaccurate data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing EDA to understand the data distribution, detect outliers, and identify correlations between variables. This step helps in identifying key factors that affect customer behavior and preferences.

- Model Development: Developing statistical and machine learning models to predict customer behavior such as booking patterns, cancellations, and preference for certain routes or amenities. This can involve using techniques such as logistic regression.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the developed models on a test dataset to measure their accuracy, precision, and recall.

- Model Deployment: Deploying the developed models into production to analyze real-time data and generate insights that can inform business decisions such as pricing strategies, customer segmentation, and marketing campaigns.

- Continuous Improvement: Continuously monitoring and updating the models to improve their accuracy and effectiveness over time.

### AI Application

The AI application for Airlines Behavioral Analytics can vary depending on the specific use case and goals of the airline. However, some potential AI applications in this area could include:

- Sentiment analysis: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer feedback from social media, customer reviews, and other sources to identify areas of customer dissatisfaction or areas where the airline can improve its services.

- Predictive maintenance: Using machine learning algorithms to analyze data from aircraft sensors, maintenance records, and other sources to predict when maintenance will be needed, allowing the airline to proactively schedule maintenance and minimize downtime.

- Flight optimization: Using machine learning algorithms to optimize flight routes and schedules to minimize delays and improve on-time performance.

- Personalization: Using customer data and machine learning algorithms to personalize the customer experience, offering customized recommendations for flights, services, and other offerings based on the customer's previous behavior and preferences.

- Fraud detection: Using machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction data and identify fraudulent activity, such as credit card fraud or ticket reselling scams

### Data
A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service"). The project is from a dataset from Kaggle. Link to the Kaggle project site: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment The dataset has to be downloaded from the above Kaggle website. The dataset has the following columns: tweet_id airline_sentiment airline_sentiment_confidence negativereason negativereason_confidence airline airline_sentiment_gold name negativereason_gold retweet_count text tweet_coord tweet_created tweet_location user_timezone
